## Still Under Development

Bold and Underline Formatting Not Applied Correctly
Unlike Qt, bold and underline styles do not apply properly, especially they are not applied only to the selected text but affect the whole text or behave inconsistently.

Tab Rename and Tab Content Independence Not Fully Implemented
The UI for renaming tabs and managing independent content per tab is implemented, but the underlying logic for true independent tab content and rename persistence is still incomplete.
